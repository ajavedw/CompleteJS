              Well, callbacks are necessary for asynchronous programming,
              including waiting for a user request, making a request to another
              server and doing something with the response, loading a file, etc.
              If you used a function synchronously instead of in a callback,
              then the function would be called before you get the data that the
              function needs and therefore it wouldn't work. As to the second
              part of your question, you could declare a function and pass that
              as the callback instead of passing in an anonymous function, both
              will work just fine.

      We need them because a lot of operations in JavaScript are asynchronous,
      or put a bit more simply they don't actually stop the program from
      continuing until they are done like you are probably used to. But instead
      just run in the background while the rest of the code continues executing.
      If you wanted to fetch some data from a server for instance (which could
      takes an unknown amount of time) it would be incredibly inefficient for
      your program to just freeze completely while it waited for that data to be
      fetched. So instead of doing that it's common to just run the fetching
      task in the background. This means that if you have two functions in a row
      with function A being asynchronous then function B will be executed while
      function A is still running. In that case if function B depends on data
      that function A is fetching you will run into problems. This problem is
      solved with callbacks. With a callback you can guarantee that function B
      is only called after function A is finished with its thing because
      function A is actually the one responsible for calling function B.
      Asynchronous functions also aren't the only use of callbacks, but they are
      the most common and useful use of them that I can think of at the top of
      my head.

      <p>Ben,</p>

      <p>
        The fundamental reason for a callback is to run code in response to an
        event. These events could be user-generated, like mouse clicks or typing
        for example. With a callback you can tell your program, "every time the
        user presses a key on the keyboard, run this code". To register a
        callback function for an event, you need to be able to pass it to
        another function, which is responsible for binding the event and
        callback together (i.e. make it so the callback executes, or runs, when
        the event occurs).
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, let's say you want to execute the function
        "<code>callback</code>" when the user clicks on the body of a webpage.
        In vanilla JS, you could write:
      </p>

      <div class="highlight highlight-javascript">
        <pre><span></span><span id="line-1"><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">body</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementsByTagName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'body'</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">];</span>
  </span><span id="line-2">
  </span><span id="line-3"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  </span><span id="line-4">  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Hello'</span><span class="p">);</span>
  </span><span id="line-5"><span class="p">}</span>
  </span><span id="line-6">
  </span><span id="line-7"><span class="nx">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'click'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">);</span>
  </span></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        In this case, we are passing a function, "<code>callback</code>" to
        another function "<code>addEventListener</code>". When
        "<code>addEventListener</code>" runs, it registers
        "<code>callback</code>" with the click event.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >Notice there are two different ways JavaScript is being run
          here.</strong
        >
        The script runs once when the page loads. Here is what happens during
        that execution:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          The "<code>body</code>" constant is declared, and a value is assigned
          to it.
        </li>
        <li>
          The function "<code>callback</code>" is declared, but not executed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The method (i.e. function) "<code>addEventListener</code>" is
          <strong>executed</strong>. (<code>callback</code> is passed in to
          <code>addEventListener</code>. Again, <code>callback</code> is not
          executed yet, only <code>addEventListener</code> is. Its job is to
          tell the browser to run <code>callback</code> when the click event
          occurs on the body.)
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Then, the other time JavaScript is run is when an event occurs, namely
        the click event. This is when the function <code>callback</code> is
        finally executed. It has only one line,
        <code>console.log('Hello');</code>. So that line executes when the body
        is clicked, and "Hello" is logged to the console. This can happen more
        than once, namely whenever the body is clicked.
      </p>

      <p>Using jQuery might look like this:</p>

      <div class="highlight highlight-javascript">
        <pre><span></span><span id="line-1"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  </span><span id="line-2">  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Hello'</span><span class="p">);</span>
  </span><span id="line-3"><span class="p">}</span>
  </span><span id="line-4">
  </span><span id="line-5"><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'body'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'click'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">);</span>
  </span></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Notice it's very similar, but we're passing "<code>callback</code>" to a
        function called "<code>on</code>", instead of
        "<code>addEventListener</code>". In either case, you're handing your
        callback function over to another function, which is taking care of
        setting up the event listener for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are other events besides user events. They could be called system
        events. The events that
        <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/nathandalbec">Nathan Dalbec</a> and
        <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/andren">andren</a> mention in their
        answers would fall into this category. In one, a callback is executed in
        response to a certain amount of time passing. In another, a callback is
        executed in response to a server returning data. The same basic thing is
        happening. An event occurs, and a callback function runs in response.
      </p>

      <p>Does this make sense?</p>
