/***********
Concept of stack and heap:
git remote -v

stack: stores primitive types--primitive types in JS are numbers, strings, boolean, null and ?
heap: stores dynamic


Heap--Variables allocated on the heap have their memory allocated at run time and accessing this memory is a bit slower, but the heap size is only limited by the size of virtual memory . Element of the heap have no dependencies with each other and can always be accessed randomly at any time. You can allocate a block at any time and free it at any time. This makes it much more complex to keep track of which parts of the heap are allocated or free at any given time.

/*  ==================================================================================================
     to add a method to a function prototype we have to add the method to
     function prototype(called class in other languges). The function prototype is basicaly
     a blueprint for object which can be used to create other objects. This prototype is also
     an object and a part of bigger object which includes default methods such hasOwnProperty(),
     toString() etc. So the object that we will create from fn prototype is able to access the
     method in fn prototype and methods of "global object" and thsi is basically prototype chain
     =================================================================================================
*/

/*
1. Every JS Object has a prototype property, whick makes inheritance possible in JS

2. The prototype property of an object/constructor function is where we put methods and props that we want other O's to
 inherit

3. The constructor prototype prop is not the protoype property of constructor itself, its the
  property of all instances that are created through it
  **for joh lets say it would be,

  john:
    properties: (if any)
    methods   ; (if any)
    __proto__: this is is the method or perty added using Person.prototype(basically this is teh prototype of Person object/ constructor function).
    Then there is,
        __proto__: Basically this is the methods of Object Object i.e the Person constructor fnunction kis by itself an object so its inherits some properties from the object of which Person is part of. e.g(hasOwnProperty() etc)

    **test

    what will be the output of
    1. john.hasOwnProperty('lastName')
    &
    2. john.hasOwnProperty('name')


4. when a method is called, its first searched in object itself, if not found there , the search moves
in to the object's prototype. this continues until the methjod is found */
